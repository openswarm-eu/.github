# OpenSwarm
Welcome to the Horizon Europe OpenSwarm project!

Here you can find repositories containing artifacts produced as part of the OpenSwarm project.
This includes mostly software (libraries, platforms, code used for papers), but also some documents (including protocols under standardization).

Feel free to browse the contents by heading to the [repositories tab](https://github.com/orgs/openswarm-eu/repositories).
